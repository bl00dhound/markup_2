                    |A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, "in circulation", from Latin: currens, -entis) in the most specific
                    | use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially
                    |circulating banknotes and coins.[1][2] A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in
                    |common use, especially in a nation.[3] Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros
                    | are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange
                    |markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.[4] Currencies in this sense are defined by governments,
                    |and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.

                        | On 15 January 1520, the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally
                        | in Joachimsthal (Czech Jáchymov) and marked on reverse with the Czech lion. The coins were called
                        | joachimsthaler, which became shortened in common usage to thaler or taler. The German name "Joachimsthal"
                        | literally means "Joachim's valley" or "Joachim's dale". This name found its way into other languages:
                        | Czech tolar, Hungarian tallér, Danish and Norwegian (rigs)daler, Swedish (riks)daler, Icelandic dalur, Dutch
                        | (rijks)daalder or daler, Ethiopian ታላሪ ("talari"), Italian tallero, Greek τάλληρον, τάλιρο, tàlleron, tàliro,
                        | Polish talar, Persian dare, as well as – via Dutch – into English as dollar.
                    p
                        | A later Dutch coin also depicting a lion was called the leeuwendaler or leeuwendaalder, literally 'lion daler'.
                        | The Dutch Republic produced these coins to accommodate its booming international trade. The leeuwendaler circulated
                        | throughout the Middle East and was imitated in several German and Italian cities. This coin was also popular in the
                        | Dutch East Indies and in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York). It was in circulation throughout the Thirteen
                        | Colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries and was popularly known as "lion (or lyon) dollar". The
                        | currencies of Romania and Bulgaria are, to this day, 'lion' (leu/leva). The modern American-English pronunciation
                    p
                        | Spanish pesos – having the same weight and shape – came to be known as Spanish dollars. By the mid-18th century, the
                        | lion dollar had been replaced by Spanish dollar, the famous "pieces of eight", which were distributed widely in the Spanish colonies
                        | in the New World and in the Philippines.
